In the far valley before me rivers of salt glimmer like a fresh winter snow. Above that mountains hide modestly behind layers of haze. To my right lone peaks part to expose waves of sand stuck flowing through time. All around shadowed hills dance endlessly with earth wind fire and water. Beneath me a million million year old rocks flaunt their minerals of every color. An ant walks across. A crow calls out. A thorn bush rustles. There is. There is not. I am god. I am not.
