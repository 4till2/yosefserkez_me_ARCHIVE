# Premises
1. The fundamental rule of life is: **It must go on.**

2. There are basic, simple and complex needs.

3. Needs are only added not removed with complexity.

## Summary
The fundamental rule of life is "It must go on". To facilitate this there are 3 categories of needs. Basic (Physical),
Simple (Psychological), and Complex (Existential). Beginning with our Physical needs which are primarily concerned with
ensuring we as an individual stay alive. This need is irrelevant to place and time, and is shared by all elements of
life. The _Physical Needs_ can be broken down to all things related with the continuation of the physical self.
**Nutrition, Health, Sleep, Shelter, Mating**. Moving down the line there are creatures like ourselves who have developed
some level of conscious support system ensuring our ongoing meeting of such physical needs, in relation to our
environment. Our ego provides an individual perspective, allowing us to respond to stimuli with consideration for not
just present stimuli, but also past and possibly future stimuli. These _Psychological Needs_ might be defined as **Acceptance** (I am supported by others) , **Confidence** (I can care for my own needs), and **Ritual** (what I am
currently doing works, and will continue to work, allowing me to expend less energy). Once these needs are met we are
introduced to the _Existential Needs_ of a very limited breed. The Homo Sapiens with their ability to tell stories.
Empowered to learn from the past, comprehend the present, and predict the future. Time is constructed, cause and effect
observed and the ego contextualized. Evolutionarily speaking this makes sense for the continuation of a specie's life,
beyond the individual. For this reason we are faced with the needs of **Purpose** (My existence is valid), **Mission** (
I can validate my existence in context of others), and **Passion** (I know where to best apply myself).

The objective here is to better understand the construct of needs, where each need lies in relation to others, how they
interact, where I am thriving or lacking, and how to align them all for a better continuation of life.

## My Understanding of Needs
### Basic Needs
###### Physical
My primary concern as a being with life, irrelevant of place and time. Fundamental elements of life. These
needs ensure I live.

- **Nutrition**
- **Health**
- **Sleep**
- **Shelter**
- **Mating**

These all exist on a spectrum from "just being met" to "healthy".

### Simple Needs
###### Psychological
I have an ego which provides an individual perspective. This conscious support system ensures my
ongoing meeting of physical needs. I respond to stimuli with my psychological needs in mind. These needs ensure I and my
community live.

- **Acceptance**: I am supported by others.
  - Self-expression (I don't need to hold onto all of my burdens)
  - Love (I can make mistakes)
- **Confidence**: I can care for my needs.
- **Ritual**: What I'm currently doing works, and will continue to work. I can expend less energy.

### Complex Needs
###### Existential
I can comprehend that which is not real. This empowers me to learn from the past, comprehend the
present, and predict the future. Time is created, cause and effect observed, and the ego is contextualized. These needs
ensure life beyond the self continues.

- **Purpose**: My existence is valid.
- **Mission**: I can validate my existence in the context of others.
- **Passion**: I know where to find serenity and best apply myself.

### Related Thoughts
- Are all needs necessary, and complications only arise when they're not met, or are there side effects of states of
  consciousness that serve no purpose and should ultimately be accepted as such and ignored?

- As consciousness evolves so do the needs of the host. As the needs of the host evolve so does the impact had by the
  specie. (single cell - fish - dog - monkey - human)

- Travel for example opens an individual up to discovering their confidence, love, and self expression, but is even more
  important for existential needs. It doesn't provide for the needs, but gives context and tooling for it.

- The distress caused by needs can be override through conscious will. The more needed it becomes the more difficult
  that is, yet nothing has more potential than the mind. With work we can comprehend, and configure our own self. Not
  all cases call for this, but if a need is reducing life, then consciousness can exalt it.
