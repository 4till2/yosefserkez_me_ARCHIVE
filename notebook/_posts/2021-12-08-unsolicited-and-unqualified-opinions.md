- Opinions are just that. A reflection of a perceived idea with or without justification. Subject to change, subject to subjectivity.
- Life is absurd. Befriending that is far better than pretending otherwise.
- I'm probably hungry.
- I'm probably overeating.
- I'm probably not drinking enough water.
- Insecurities are a strong motivator when paired with optimism and an even stronger inhibitor when paired with pessimism.
- We don't all share the same perspective on reality. By definition our own view's of reality are intuitive truisms. This makes it difficult to conceive the differences in others. It can help to remember its frequently not the conclusions that differ, but the premise. When in doubt challenge a premise. An honest inquiry from the premise will yield more understanding.
- Subjective truths are important too. But respect them as that.
- To choose proactivity today prevents one from the prison of reactivity tomorrow.
- Change is inevitable and painful. It works in two directions. Growth and degradation. Degradation is the default. More bluntly, choose life or die.
- The absurdism of life need not be more important than anything else.
- The gift of consciousness is
- Optimize the now for the total of your experience, past present and future. You are who and where you remember yourself to be, and consequently anticipate yourself to be, in the current moment. In this way our time is non-linear.
- History is the organism of today.
- En mass anything possible is plausible.
- The great enemy of the individual is the insecure self.
- Art is communication. Language, paintings, photography, interpretive dance, poetry, and mathematics are all attempts to communicate from the depths of one mind to another.
